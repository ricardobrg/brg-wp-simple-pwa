# BRG WordPress Simple PWA
The simplest WordPress PWA ever!

## 1. About
I've been playing around with PWA in WordPress for the last months. After 2 WordCamps talking about it, it was time to show some code!

PWAs can be very complex client side apps. This one is the simplest PWA I could imagine, just to show the basic features of PWAs and how they integrate with WordPress REST API without no need to code anything in the server side. No plugins, themes, hooks or actions. Just pure vanilla JavaScript (no JQuery! :-0 )  , some fancy CSS and the old and good HTML.

## 2. How to use
This repository was divided in steps, so it's easier to learn. Each step is a branch and it covers specific resources
* Step 1 - app structure: define app shell, service worker and manifest.json
* TODO other steps

## 3. How to learn
The best way to start with the basics of PWA is with [PWA Google code lab](google.com). That's where I recommend you to start with. Then just fork this repo and play around with WordPress and PWA!
